    I have always had an interest in the latest technology and this has led to me building my own PC tailored for gaming and numerical simulations for my university projects. I always like upgrading the components so I have the best that technology has to offer. </p>

<p> I can play the clarinet up to a grade 5 and have taught myself how to play the basics of guitar and piano. I was a member of the school orchestra and choir where I performed regularly in concerts and assemblies. These performances improved my confidence and led to me earning a music award with the school.</p>

<p>I was a dedicated member of the scouting society from the age of 6 to 18. I have been the leader of scouting patrols through many hiking competitions and placed within the top 5 of the whole district for each one. This tested my ability to lead and work with a team and led to me earning a Jack Petchey award and the chief scouts gold award. </p>
